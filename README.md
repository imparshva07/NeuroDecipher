# Neuro Decipher

Leveraging cutting-edge technologies like Angular, Node.js, MongoDB, and Machine Learning (ANN & Logistic Regression), we developed a communication system which enables patients to convey critical messages to doctors in real-time. This innovative solution utilizes EEG data to interpret patient messages, ensuring timely assistance in emergency situations.

- Engaged with industry clients to implement Agile Methodology, optimizing project development processes, monitoring project advancement, and identifying bottlenecks.

Key Features:
- EEG data analysis using Machine Learning models
- Real-time message interpretation and transmission to doctor's dashboard
- Emergency alerts for critical messages like "help me" or "stop"
- Empowering patients with communication difficulties to connect with doctors

Impact:
This project has the potential to transform healthcare communication, enabling swift and effective patient-doctor interactions.Leveraging cutting-edge technologies like Angular, Node.js, MongoDB, and Machine Learning (ANN & Logistic Regression), we developed a communication system which enables patients to convey critical messages to doctors in real-time.
